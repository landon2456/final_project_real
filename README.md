# Drug Use by Age
I chose the dataset "Drug Use by Age" from FiveThirtyEight's github. This data had information about the percentage of the respondents who reported using certain drugs within the past 12 months, and the frequency in which they used those drugs over the past 12 months. The data covers 13 different drugs across 17 age groups. The data came in one csv file that I put onto a google sheet. I then did the following to analyze the data:
* Sorted heroin use z-a to find the top groups were: 22-23 (1.1%), 20 (0.9%), and 24-25 (0.7%)
* Sorted hallucinogen use z-a to find the top groups: 19 (8.6%), 20 (7.4%), and 19 (7%). 
* Sorted hallucinogen frequency Z-A, to find the top groups: 12 (52), 50-64 (44), 13 (6)
* Sorted inhalant use Z-A, to find the top groups: 16 (3%), 14 (2.6%), 15 (2.5%) , 13 (2.5%)

An interesting finding here was that heroin was the oldest, hallucinogens were a bit younger but still within the usual drug experimentation age, and inhalants were youngest. This confirmed my suspicions that inhalants would be more popular among young people who may not have legal or illegal access to more 'serious' drugs. I also speculated that heroin was something people do after they've been doing drugs for a while, and is something older people are more likely to do as since it is done out of necessity rather than fun. This is in contrast to psychedelics which are rarely done habitually and are more for when you want to experiment and have fun, so they would attract a demographic that doesn't have quite as many formal responsibilities yet. Finally, a notable outlier was the 50-64 group in hallucinogen frequency. The hallucinogen use for this age group was only 0.3%

I then wanted to find a way to group together the depressants and stimulants because I noticed they were each divided into multiple categories in the original data. I tried using OpenRefine to consolidate the groups together but could not figure out how to do this the way I wanted to, so I went back to google sheets
